# Crawlr Backend API

Crawlr is a Social Gathering Platform that allows users to create and join pub crawls in the area. This application uses the Yelp API to locate bars in the New York City area, with roll-outs to other geographical locations in the future. The backend API was accomplished using a Rails API and Postgres.
